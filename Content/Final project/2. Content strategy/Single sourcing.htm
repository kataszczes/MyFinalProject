        <h1>Single sourcing</h1>
        <p>In both content creation and localization, avoiding redundancy and maximizing efficiency are essential. One of the most powerful strategies to achieve this in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Flare" /> is single sourcing.</p>
        <p>Single sourcing is the practice of writing and managing content once, and then reusing or repurposing it in multiple contexts, such as different outputs, audiences, or product versions, without duplicating the source material. This approach not only increases consistency and reduces maintenance effort, but it also provides a significant advantage during localization.</p>
        <div class="tip">Interestingly, single sourcing shares conceptual similarities with Translation Memory (TM) used in the localization process. TM is a database that stores previously translated segments (sentences, paragraphs, or phrases). When the same or similar content appears again, the translation system suggests the stored translation instead of translating it from scratch. In much the same way, single sourcing allows authors to reuse existing content blocks, reducing the number of segments that need to be created, reviewed, or translated.</div>
        <p>By combining single sourcing strategies in Flare with the benefits of Translation Memory in tools like <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Lingo" /> or third-party CAT tools, organizations can dramatically reduce translation costs, turnaround times, and the potential for inconsistency across languages and versions.</p>
        <h3>Why single sourcing matters for localization</h3>
        <p>When preparing content for translation, every unique segment adds to the cost and time involved. Repetitive, similar content must still be processed and reviewed unless a proper reuse strategy is in place. Without single sourcing, even small updates to shared content require manual tracking and retranslation. Single sourcing ensures that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>You only write (and translate) content once.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can make global updates to content blocks, affecting every instance where they are used.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Your localized versions stay consistent across different deliverables.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Key single sourcing features in Flare</h3>
        <h4>Topic-based authoring</h4>
        <p>Flare’s content model is based on individual topics rather than monolithic documents. Each topic represents a standalone piece of information, such as a procedure, concept, or reference, that can be assembled into multiple outputs (like PDFs or online help). For localization:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>This ensures that only updated topics need to be sent for translation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Translators can work with smaller, more manageable content units.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Topics can be reused across products, platforms, and documentation sets.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Snippets</h4>
        <p><a href="../3. Writing for localization/Prudent use of Flare features/Snippets.htm">Snippets</a> are reusable chunks of content, such as recurring safety warnings, disclaimers, or standard instructions. Rather than copying and pasting the same content across topics, you can insert a snippet. This has multiple advantages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>When the source snippet changes, every instance is updated automatically.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Snippets reduce the volume of content that needs to be translated.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Translators only need to translate the snippet once, regardless of how many times it appears.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example use cases for snippets:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Legal text blocks</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Common troubleshooting steps</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Headers and footers</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>UI descriptions</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Variables</h4>
        <p><a href="../3. Writing for localization/Prudent use of Flare features/Variables.htm">Variables</a> act as placeholders for text that may vary across outputs or languages, such as product names, company names, version numbers, or feature flags.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><code>ProductName</code> = "Flare"</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><code>VersionNumber</code> = "2024.1"</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Using variables:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Ensures consistency across all content.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Simplifies translation—translators don’t need to worry about product or brand terms changing unexpectedly, or making a typo.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Makes updates simple—you only change the variable value, not every occurrence in the content.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="tip">Localization benefit: Only the variable definitions need to be translated once per language, not every occurrence in the document.</div>
        <h4>Conditional text</h4>
        <p><a href="../3. Writing for localization/Prudent use of Flare features/Conditions.htm">Conditional text</a> allows you to include or exclude content based on defined conditions (like product version, region, or audience). This is particularly useful in multilingual or multi-product documentation scenarios and eliminates the need for separate projects for each variation, reducing duplication and improving scalability.</p>
        <h4>Target management</h4>
        <p>Targets in Flare define the output settings, such as the format (HTML5, PDF, Word), language, condition sets, variable definitions, and style sheets. Each target can generate a tailored version of your documentation, all from a single source.</p>
