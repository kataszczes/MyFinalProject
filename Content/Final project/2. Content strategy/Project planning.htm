        <h1>Project planning</h1>
        <p>Before initiating a Flare project with localization goals, thoughtful and structured planning is crucial. This stage sets the foundation for the overall project and influences every subsequent step—from content creation and translation to output and maintenance.</p>
        <h3>Define scope and objectives</h3>
        <p>Start by answering key strategic questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>What is the primary language, and which target languages are required?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>What deliverables are expected? (for example: HTML5 Help, PDFs, Knowledge Base articles)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Who are the stakeholders, and what are their expectations?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>What platforms or CMS will host the final content?</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These considerations help determine the scope of translation and localization, the tools you'll need, and the level of complexity involved.</p>
        <h3>Understand the audience</h3>
        <p>When planning for localization, it’s essential to recognize the cultural and contextual expectations of your audience. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Regional language variants (for example, Brazilian Portuguese vs. European Portuguese)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Reading direction (left-to-right vs. right-to-left)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Technical literacy or tone preferences</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This user-awareness will guide language choice, terminology, and even visuals.</p>
        <h3>Budget and timeline</h3>
        <p>Localization can be costly and time-consuming, especially when dealing with multiple outputs and languages. Early on, estimate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Cost per word for translation</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Time per translation cycle (authoring → translating → reviewing → publishing)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Resources needed for internal QA and in-country review</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Consider scheduling buffers for content changes late in the cycle or feedback from localization reviewers.</p>
        <h3>Select the right workflow and tools</h3>
        <p>Choosing the correct workflow is one of the most influential decisions in the planning phase. Will you be using:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><a href="../4. Choose translation method/MadCap Lingo.htm">MadCap Lingo</a> for integrated translation and project management?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><a href="../4. Choose translation method/Output files.htm">MadCap Flare output files</a>?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A <a href="../4. Choose translation method/XLIFF.htm">third-party CAT tool</a>, with XLIFF exports from Lingo?</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These decisions will affect your folder structures, topic development, and conditional content management later in the process.</p>
        <h3>Establish translation criteria</h3>
        <p>Establish measurable criteria for what content should or should not be translated:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Legal or region-specific information</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Embedded media</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>UI elements and screenshots</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Content reused across products or versions</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This ensures cost-effective localization and avoids wasting resources on unnecessary or low-impact content.</p>
        <h3>Documentation</h3>
        <p>Maintain clear documentation for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Project structure and naming conventions</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Translation requirements</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Contact points for translators and reviewers</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Review and sign-off procedures</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Clear documentation improves consistency and speeds up onboarding for new contributors or translators.</p>
