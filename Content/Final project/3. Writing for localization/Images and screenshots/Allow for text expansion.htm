        <h1 class="h1-mcThirdLevel">Allow for text expansion</h1>
        <p>Translated text often occupies more space than the original language. For instance, German translations can be up to 30% longer than their English counterparts. Without accommodating this expansion, text may overlap or extend beyond designated areas in images.</p>
        <h3>Best practices:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="bulletIntroduction">Design flexible layouts:</span> When creating callouts or annotations, ensure they can expand or contract based on text length. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Capture" /> supports auto-sizing of text boxes, which adjusts the size dynamically to fit the content .</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="bulletIntroduction">Test with pseudo-localization:</span> Implement pseudo-localization techniques to simulate text expansion and identify potential layout issues before actual translation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="bulletIntroduction">Avoid fixed-size containers:</span> Refrain from using fixed-size text containers in images. Instead, allow for dynamic resizing to accommodate varying text lengths.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
