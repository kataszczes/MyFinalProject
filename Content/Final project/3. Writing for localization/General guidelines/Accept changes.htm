        <h1 class="h1-mcThirdLevel">Accept changes</h1>
        <p>Before sending content for translation, it's critical to accept all tracked changes in your <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Flare" /> project or source documents. While tracked changes are helpful during review, leaving them in place can cause serious issues in localization.</p>
        <h3>Why it matters</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="bulletIntroduction">Word count inflation:</span> Both deleted and inserted text may be counted, increasing translation cost unnecessarily.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="bulletIntroduction">Translator confusion:</span> It's unclear which version of the text is final, leading to delays or errors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="bulletIntroduction">Tool compatibility:</span> CAT tools (including <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Lingo" />) may not handle tracked changes correctly, which can cause formatting or segmentation issues.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Best practices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="bulletIntroduction">Finalize edits before exporting:</span> Ensure reviews are complete and content is stable.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="bulletIntroduction">Accept or reject all changes:</span> Use Flare’s Review pane to confirm a clean state.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="bulletIntroduction">Export only the finalized version:</span> This ensures translators receive consistent, unambiguous input.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
