        <h1 class="h1-mcThirdLevel">Style guides and glossaries</h1>
        <p>Standardizing how your team writes and translates terminology is essential for maintaining consistency, readability, and professional quality across all localized content. In multilingual projects, inconsistency can erode user trust, confuse readers, and increase translation costs due to avoidable rework. This is where style guides and glossaries become vital.</p>
        <h3>Why a style guide matters</h3>
        <p>A well-structured style guide serves as a reference document for authors, editors, and translators alike. It defines how content should be written and formatted in both the source and target languages. Key benefits include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="bulletIntroduction">Enforcing consistency:</span> Ensures the same tone, sentence structure, and terminology across topics, contributors, and languages.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="bulletIntroduction">Grammar and tone guidance:</span> Clarifies whether content should be formal or conversational, active or passive, and provides examples of preferred constructions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="bulletIntroduction">Formatting standards:</span> Specifies how to format:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>
                        <p>Units of measurement (for example, metric vs. imperial)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Numbering and bullet styles</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Capitalization rules</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Quotation marks (for example, “English” vs. «French»)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Decimal separators (for example, 1,000.00 vs. 1.000,00)</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="bulletIntroduction">Audience and purpose alignment:</span> Defines who the content is for (for example, technicians vs. end users), helping writers adjust complexity and tone accordingly.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="bulletIntroduction">Language-specific notes:</span> Style guides tailored to a specific language can include instructions on gendered language, formal address, and sentence length preferences.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Glossaries for terminology management</h3>
        <p>A glossary is more than a word list—it's a controlled vocabulary that shows approved translations of key terms. It’s especially important for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="bulletIntroduction">Technical terms:</span> Ensures consistency in complex domains like software, engineering, or healthcare.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="bulletIntroduction">UI strings and labels:</span> Matches wording used in the software interface so users are not confused by mismatches between the UI and documentation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="bulletIntroduction">Untranslatable terms:</span> Identifies brand names, product names, acronyms, or code elements that should remain in English or their source language.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="bulletIntroduction">Avoiding false friends:</span> Notes terms that shouldn’t be translated literally to avoid miscommunication or cultural errors.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Benefits for the localization workflow</h3>
        <ul>

                <p>Reduces translator queries and inconsistencies.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Improves translation memory (TM) leverage.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Ensures better QA outcomes with fewer revision cycles.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Speeds up onboarding of new linguists or team members.</p>
