        <h1>General guidelines</h1>
        <p>The foundation of localization-friendly content starts with clarity, consistency, and simplicity. Source content should be easily understandable by translators and structured to avoid ambiguity, misinterpretation, or unnecessary complexity.</p>
        <p>Key considerations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Write content assuming it will be translated into multiple languages.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Keep terminology consistent across your documentation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use tools like style guides, glossaries, and templates to standardize structure and tone.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Plan for translation from the start, even if localization is not immediately required.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>By focusing on high-quality source content, organizations set the stage for accurate and efficient localization later in the project lifecycle.</p>
