        <h1>Formatting for localization</h1>
        <p>While writing content for localization, formatting is often overlooked as merely a visual concern. However, the way content is formatted—through stylesheets, page layouts, and UI structure—can significantly impact the cost, complexity, and quality of the localization process. Poor formatting decisions can result in hardcoded language, inaccessible styles, broken layouts in translated outputs, or even the need to localize CSS or redo print formatting per language.</p>
        <p>This section focuses on specific formatting considerations that influence localization readiness, especially when working in a structured environment like <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Flare" />.</p>
