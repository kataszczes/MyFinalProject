        </div>
        <p>Creating localizable content is a critical component in building user-friendly documentation that supports global audiences. While translation handles converting content from one language to another, localization is more holistic—it adjusts content to reflect cultural nuances, regulatory norms, and formatting expectations specific to each locale. This section outlines strategies and practices for writing content that is localization-ready from the outset, significantly improving quality and reducing translation costs and turnaround time.</p>
